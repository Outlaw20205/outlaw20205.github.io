# Travel

I've had the opportunity to visit many places in the USA and Canada. Some of the place I have been to are NYC, Mount Rushmore, Toronto, Pikes Peak, the Gulf Shores and other places outside of Missouri. I would have to say my favorite place I've gone to is Toronto and the surrounding area.
