# Motorsports

I've attend roughly 10 motor racing events in person but I've watched hundreds of them throughout my life. My favorite series to watch are NASCAR, IndyCar, IMSA, WEC and F1. I do enjoy watching smaller local series as well. When I'm at the track; I love walking the entire facility, exploring the garages, taking pictures of the cars and of course watching the races. If I every have the opportunity, I would love to compete in a real race.
