``` As mentioned in the home page, I have many hobbies so here they are in greater detail:

    I've attend roughly 10 motor racing events in person but I've watched hundreds of them throughout my life.
    My favorite series to watch are NASCAR, IndyCar, IMSA, WEC and F1. I do enjoy watching smaller local series as well.
    When I'm at the track; I love walking the entire facility, exploring the garages, taking pictures of the cars and of course watching the races.
    If I every have the opportunity, I would love to compete in a real race.

    I didn't mention this one but I like making liveries for games I play. I've recreated 
    real life liveries of vehicles but I've also made my own designs.
