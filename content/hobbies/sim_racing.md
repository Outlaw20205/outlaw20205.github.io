# Sim Racing

My love for motorsports carries over to video games as well. I compete on an amatuer esports team that does endurance races on games like iRacing. Some of those events last up to 24 hours at a time but they are always a blast. Here's a few pictures from some of the races I've done.

I didn't mention this on the main page but I like making liveries for games I play as well. I've recreated real life liveries of vehicles but I've also made my own designs.
